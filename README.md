# Game of Votes

### Inspiration
As avid fans of Game of Thrones, we can't wait for the release of Season 6. Luckily, the 2016 US Presidential elections have graced us with enough absurdity, scandal and outrageous characters.

### What it does
It is a Chrome Extension that changes the names of political candidates, locations, quotes and images to their respective Game of Thrones equivalents.

This extension was built by Daniel Moreno, Luke Carlson, Connor Swords, and Noah Shpak for PennApps 2015.

Download it on [the Chrome Store] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/game-of-votes/mmddbannaegmndpmplfcjlnkadiohklm?hl=en)
